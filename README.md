# Astrologer-Recommendation

A mini-project built for a technical assignment. This repository contains a smart engine that recommends astrologers to users by analyzing their chat history using semantic search.

### Core Components

- **recommendation_engine.ipynb:** A Jupyter Notebook that takes mock user chat data and returns the top 3 most relevant astrologers using Sentence-Transformers for embeddings and cosine similarity.
- **bonus_task.txt:** Pseudocode for a small LLM agent designed to act as a basic AI astrologer, providing life insights from a horoscope or palm reading.
